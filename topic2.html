    <p align="center">Wrestling came naturally fo the rock, as his farthe and grandfather both participated in the sport.  After his attempt at football, Johnson wanted to get in on the "family business".
      After successfully getting a contract to the WWF, Dwayne started going under the stage name "Rocky Maivia" and was hyped as the WWF's first 3rd generation wrestler.  Sometime in the in his early career, Johnson started referring tp himself in the 3rd person as "The Rock".
    "The Rock has been listed as one of the all-time greatest professional wrestlers as well as one of the top box office draws in wrestling history.  Hulk Hogan called The Rock "the biggest superstar in this business", and 16-time world champion John Cena described him as "the biggest superstar in the history of WWE".
     In "Cable Visions: Television Beyond Broadcasting", The Rock was described as 'for a long time, the WWE's biggest star and probably held the greatest international appeal'. R.D. Reynolds stated in his book "The WrestleCrap Book of Lists" that The Rock was 'the biggest star for WWE from 1999 until 2004'.
     Many wrestlers placed The Rock on their 'Mount Rushmore of Wrestling' including Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Chris Jericho and John Cena." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwayne_Johnson#Legacy_in_wrestling">Wikipedia</a></p>
