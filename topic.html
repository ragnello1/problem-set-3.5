      igneous rock, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock. Metamorphic Rock forms from other rocks that are
      changed by heat and pressure. Rocks can be igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, depending on how the rock formed." -

    <h2 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;" id="ign">Igneous Rocks</h2>
    <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">"Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for fire) form from when hot,
      molten rock crystallizes and solidifies. The melt originates deep within the Earth near active plate boundaries or hot spots,
      then rises toward the surface. Igneous rocks are divided into two groups, intrusive or extrusive, depending upon where the molten rock solidifies." -

      <h3 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Intrusive Igneous Rocks</h3>
      <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;"> An Intrusive Rock is formed when magma trapped inside of the earth begins to rise towards the surface fo the Earth.
      The magma stays trapped underground and over millions of years, begins to cool down and solidifies into a large underground rock formation.
      Intrusive rocks feature coarse and grainy textures due to the solidified chunks of minerals that the extended period of time it takes for the magma to cool create.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <h3 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Extrusive Igneous Rocks</h3>
      <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Extrusive rocks are formed when magma comes up from the ground and cools on the surface of the earth.
        This magma is called lava, and it cools and solidifies very shortly after erupting out of volcanoes or oozing fissures.  This quicker cooling makes it hard for minerals to grow over time,
        so these rocks have a much glassier texture.</p>

  <h2 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;" id="meta">Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
    <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">"Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock, but have been substantially changed from their original igneous, sedimentary,
      or earlier metamorphic form. Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat, high pressure, hot mineral-rich fluids or, more commonly, some combination of these factors.
      Conditions like these are found deep within the Earth or where tectonic plates meet." - <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-metamorphic-rocks-0?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">USGS</a></p>

      <h3 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
      <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Foliated metamorphic rocks have stripes in their appearance.  This is formed when the pressure put on the rocks make the different minerals aligned.
      Through this process, teh lining up of the different minerals that make up the metamorphic rock form stipes in between themselves.  Also, the rocks develop a sheet-like structure that reflect the direction the pressure pressed the minerals.</p>

    <td>
      <h3 align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Non-Foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
      <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">Non-Foliated Metamorphic rocks do not have the same sheet-like structure of Foliated Metamorphic Rocks.  These types of rocks are formed in a number of ways.
      "Some rocks, such as limestone are made of minerals that are not flat or elongate. No matter how much pressure you apply, the grains will not align! Another type of metamorphism, contact metamorphism, occurs when hot igneous rock intrudes into some pre-existing rock.
      The pre-existing rock is essentially baked by the heat, changing the mineral structure of the rock without addition of pressure." - <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-metamorphic-rocks-0?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">USGS</a></p>

  <p align="center" style="font-family:helvetica;">"Sedimentary rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organisms. They form from deposits that accumulate on the Earth's surface. Sedimentary rocks often have distinctive layering or bedding.
    Many of the picturesque views of the desert southwest show mesas and arches made of layered sedimentary rock." - <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-sedimentary-rocks-0?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">USGS</a></p>

If the sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock."  -
