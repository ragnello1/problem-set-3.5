    <p align="center">"Rocks are classified according to characteristics such as mineral and chemical composition,
      permeability, texture of the constituent particles, and particle size. These physical properties are the result of the processes that formed
      the rocks. Over the course of time, rocks can transform from one type into another, as described by a geological model called the rock cycle.
      This transformation produces three general classes of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)#Classification" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

    <h3 align="center">Rock (Music)</h3>
        <p align="center">The third and final form of Rock comes in the form of music that have been dubbed, "Rock and Roll". "It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on
          the African-American genres of blues and rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk,
          and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass,
          drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse.
          Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music">Wikipedia</a>
